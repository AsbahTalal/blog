## Hey there!

My name is Asbah Talal and I am an college freshman from Oklahoma, USA. I go to Texas A&M University with hopes of completing my Mechanical Engineering degree. 

I'm interested in 
- math, science, and programming, particularly physics 
- fencing; i love the feeling of being in a bout and try to improve every meet
- photography; especially when traveling
- painting; Something I do for fun. I used to paint a lot during covid and it is something I am definitely trying to make time for.
- volunteering; i typically spend my weekend volunteering at the museum, library, centers, and places where I can help out the community.
- making YT videos about my interests
- solving fun problems 
- reading books; I highly recommend *Life of Pi* and *Catcher in the Rye*.

I love talking with most people so feel free to contact me through Instagram, email, or Discord. See ya!
